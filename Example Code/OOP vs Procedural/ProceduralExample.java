| Description: Demonstrates an example of Procedural Programming for a
|              game where robots attack each other. When looking at it,
|              ask yourself questions such as:
|                > How much work would be involved in creating a 4th
|                  robot? Or to create 10 more?
|                > How much work would be involved in both creating and
|                  working with additional robot attributes? Especially
|                  when it comes to the methods which 'realize' them?
|                > How easy would it be to pass unintentional/mistaken 
|                  inputs to the methods?
|
| Scalability: These questions relate to a MAJOR Software Engineering
|              concept/strategy called 'scaling' or 'scalability', for
|              which we offer a basic definition...
|                > Scalability: How possible is it for some program or
|                  system to grow/expand to support additional features,
|                  functionality, and capacity (in terms of data and the
|                  number of things defined by / using that data)?
|                > Scaling: The process of growing/expanding a program
|                  or system to support such features, functionality, 
|                  and capacity.
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Special Notes: 
|   - For this example, pretend that arrays and strings are NOT objects
|     (as is the case with the 'C' language).

	 *   (2) If armor now below zero, target's health absorbs deficit,
	 *       and armor is reset to zero.
	 *   (3) If health now below zero, target's health is reset to zero,
	 *       and its alive status set to false.
	 *   (4) Attacker's attack count is incremented by one.
