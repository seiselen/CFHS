# FH-4710 FA-21 : Assignment 2

### Assigned: 8/23/21 @ 05:00 PM MST
### Due: 8/23/21 @ 11:59 PM MST
### Version: 0.5 8/22/21

## General Instructions:

* Provide (i.e. implement) definitions for the following methods via their respecrive problem definitions as specified. Submission Instructions will eventually be posted at the botttom of this spec: once we figure out how soon we can get Repl up-and-running; though the backup option will be submitting a .java file to the Google Classroom. Stay Tuned...
* Your code will be tested for correctness via being called with a number of test cases; such that your score on each will follow from the percent of test cases passed. Refer to the assignment rubric for additional grading information. 
* With the exception of code presented by the instructor (i.e. provided to the class for use, demonstrated in class, etc.): all code that you submit must only be that which you alone have written; i.e. you must NOT share or discuss code with other students! We may utilize plaigarism detection mechanisms to check for syntactically (and even sematically) similar code, request an oral exam (i.e. in-person interview) to ask you questions about your implementation code, and conduct further investigation. A first confirmed violation of acadamic integrity will result in an instant unrecoverable zero on the assignment and friendly warning not to copy-paste code again (i.e. a "slap on the wrist"). Further violaions will result in the maximum penalties thereof following our courses' "Zero-Tolerance, Maximum-Penalty" policy; including parent/admin notification, possible removal of all 'Participation/Behavior' points, and possible expulsion from the class (i.e. perma-ban). If you're concerned about whether your work on assignment might be a violation of academic integrity: ask the instructor ASAP!
* That said: you are allowed (if not encouraged!) to collaborate with your classmates in terms of discussing 'high-level' ideas and algorithms pertaining to possible solutions (though nothing as/more detailed than pseudocode). If you're unsure about what can 'legally' be discussed: again - ask the instructor! If you do work with a group, you MUST provide the names of your collaborator(s) in either a README document or within a header comment block within your submission source code file(s). As mentioned in class: we will not be micromanaging who you work with and how you do it; but we do suggest that you avoid working with classmates who do not make an effort to contribute ideas or productive discussion (i.e. 'dead weight'); and your otherwise mutually beneficial teammate(s) and yourself are welcome to email the instructor if such people are taking unfair advantage. We'll honor your annonymity and find a way to resolve the situation as best as possible.
* Another caveat: the one kind of code of which you are welcome (and also encouraged) to share are test cases for the various problems. Indeed: we will be releasing our test cases within a few days, which will be the very ones used to evaluate (i.e. grade) your code!
* Lastly: the classic 'Subject To Change' statement. While the content and number of these problems is unlikely to change, we may add details for clarification or even add/remove them as needed (typical in new{er} programming courses). You will be provided notice and explanation whenever such events occur, sans things like minor spelling corrections. We will NEVER modify an assignment in an adverse manner (i.e. purposely make the work harder); and will try to NOT change an assignment anytime after 5:00PM on the ~3rd day after an assignment is posted.

## Part 1 : Warmup

### isEven
```Java
public static boolean isEven(int val)
```
* **Purpose:** Given an integer, returns whether or not it is an even number.
* **Input:** `int val` - the input integer
* **Hint:** One of the arithmetic operators can be used to solve this with a single statement.

### isOdd
```Java
public static boolean isOdd(int val)
```
* **Purpose:** Given an integer, returns whether or not it is an odd number.
* **Input:** `int val` - the input integer
* **Hint:** If `isEven` correctly works, its code can solve this with only a simple addition.

### getEvens
```Java
public static int[] getEvens(int extent)
```
* **Purpose:** Returns an int array containing all positive even integers up to and including the
input `extent` (if it happens to be even).
* **Input:** `int extent` – the input integer 
* **Hint:** Function `isEven` can help with this, as can being creative with a for loop's header.

### getOdds
```Java
public static int[] getOdds(int extent)
```
* **Purpose:** Returns an int array containing all positive odd integers numbers up to and
including the input `extent` (if it happens to be odd).
* **Input:** `int extent` – the input integer
* **Hint:** As with `isEven` and `isOdd`, this can be solved via slightly modifying a correct implementation of `getEvens`.

## Part 2 : 12/24 Hour Time Conversion

### Instructions:
Define the following methods. Do NOT use any of Java's time Classes/methods (nor other external assets); as the purpose is to build experience points coding your own solutions. We will use Strings to represent 12-hour and 24-hour time systems as follows:

System | Syntax | Example
------ | ------ | -------
*12-Hour* | `"H:M X" s.t. H∈[01,12], M∈[00,59], X∈{AM⊕PM}` | `"03:14 PM"`
*24-Hour* | `"H:M" s.t. H∈[00,23], M∈[00,59]` | `"15:14"`

### time24to12
```Java
public static String time24to12(String time)
```
* **Purpose:** Given time in 24-H format, return corresponding time in 12-H format.
* **Input:** `String time` – the input time in 24-H format as specified in above definition
* **Hint:** Exploit the specificity of the time format[s] to parse input and prep output

### time12to24
```Java
public static String time12to24(String time)
```
* **Purpose:** Given time in 12-H format, return corresponding time in 24-H format.
* **Input:** `String time` – the input time in 12-H format as specified in above definition
* **Hint:** Exploit the specificity of the time format[s] to parse input and prep output

## Part 2 : Temperature Unit Conversion / Queries

### Instructions:
Define the following methods. For the first two: we want you to code the Celsius <-> Farenheit conversion formulae from scratch to get the coding experience points. As to what those formulae are, you could refer to any basic science reference, else the ‘mathisfun’ article [(linked here)](https://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html) provides a good enough description. As with the time-based methods: do NOT use any built-in nor external temperature conversion libraries.

### farToCel
```Java
public static float farToCel(float far)
```
* **Purpose:** Given a temperature in Fahrenheit, return its analogous Celsius value; i.e. return
the value of the input temperature converted into Celsius.
* **Input:** `float far` – a temperature in Fahrenheit

### celToFar
```Java
public static float celToFar(float cel)
```
* **Purpose:** Given a temperature in Celsius, return its analogous Fahrenheit value; i.e. return
the value of the input temperature converted into Fahrenheit.
* **Input:** `float` cel – a temperature in Celsius

### isFreezing
```Java
public static boolean isFreezing(float temp, char type)
```
* **Purpose:** Given an input temperature and type thereof, return whether the temperature is at
or below the freezing point of water (<=32 if Fahrenheit, <=0 if Celsius). If an invalid type
char is entered (see ‘inputs’ below for valid options), report this fact to the console, then
return ‘false’.
* **Inputs:**
  * `float temp` - a temperature in Celsius xor Fahrenheit
  * `char type` - the type of temperature, where `f`=>`Fahrenheit` and `c`=>`Celsius`
* **Hint:** Use of correctly working `farToCel` and  `celToFar` methods can reduce the amount of code needed.

### isBoiling
```Java

public static boolean isBoiling(float temp, char type) 
```
* **Purpose:** Given an input temperature and type thereof, return whether the temperature is at
or above the boiling point of water (`temp>=212` if Fahrenheit, `temp>=100` if Celsius). If an invalid
type char is entered (see below for valid options), return ‘false’.
* **Inputs:**
  * `float temp` - a temperature in Celsius xor Fahrenheit
  * `char type` - the type of temperature, where `f`=>`Fahrenheit` and `c`=>`Celsius`
* **Hint:** Analogous to the Part 1 methods, a correctly working `isFreezing` can be recycled to solve this.

## Part 3 : Mapping Between Ranges and Onto Cells

### Instructions:
Define the following two methods with only the basic building blocks discussed in class (again – for coding experience points). Both are commonly utilized in Data Visualization, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), and of course: Game/Simulation Programming. For example: “mapToRange” is analogous to Processing’s “map()” method [(reference)](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html). I thus suggest keeping your version in your *'snippets'* archive, as it will likely be useful in future projects.
* **I sure did:** My homebrew version of `mapToRange` was originally written in 2016 and has been ported into 3 languages (Java, JavaScript, and C#) across several of my projects under names such as `lerpMap`, `steveMapToRange`, etc.

### coordToCell
```Java
public static int[] coordToCell(float xPos, float yPos, int cellSize)
```
* **Purpose:** Given the `x` and `y` coordinates of a position within a 2D Cartesian Plane partitioned into a grid of equally-sized square-shaped cells of diameter `cellSize`, return the row and column of the cell corresponding to the position - in that order.
* **Inputs:**
  * `float xPos` - **x** coordinate of the position 
  * `float yPos` - **y** coordinate of the position 
  * `int cellSize` - **diameter** of cells of grid world (i.e. length and width of each cell)

* **Hint 1:** Remember that for *Row-Major* array architectures as seen in Java, we would address a particular cell in some array `arr` as `arr[row][col]`; and that rows associate with the **y** coordinate while columns associate with the **x** coordinate. Thus, coordinates and row/col indices are opposite one another in terms of their ordering.
* **Hint 2:** You could consider this method analogous to one which *'rounds down'* `xPos` and `yPos` to the nearest cellSize, then integer divides thereby. For example: `coordToCell(123.45, 678.91, 100) => {6,1}`
* **Output:** `int[2]` whose contents compose the `{row,column}` of the cell where the query point/position is located.

### mapToRange
```Java
public static float mapToRange(float val, float inMin, float inMax, float outMin, float outMax)
```
* **Purpose:** Maps `val` (which exists in the range `[inMin,...,inMax]` into the range `[inMin,...,inMax]`. This method is analogous to Processing’s `map` method, as discussed in the instructions/overviw. Some examples are further discussed below.
* **Inputs:**
  * `float val` - value to be mapped to a new range
  * `float inMin` - min bound of input value range
  * `float inMax` - max bound of input value range
  * `float outMin` - min bound of output value range
  * `float outMax` - max bound of output value range
* **Hint 1:** This can be reduced to a single line of code, but we suggest starting out with writing expressions on several lines. We also suggest first trying to figure out how to do this on your own, before looking at the spoiler code we provide at this link [(SPOILER)](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Map_range#Java). And YES, you can refer to it for your solution... but you MUST mention that you did so via an inline comment, and try not to simply do a copy-paste!
