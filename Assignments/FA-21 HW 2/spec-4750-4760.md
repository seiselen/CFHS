# FH-4750/4760 FA-21 : Assignment 2

### Assigned: 8/23/21 @ 05:00 PM MST
### Due: 8/30/21 @ 11:59 PM MST
### Version: 1.0 8/23/21

## General Instructions:

* **Implement solutions for the following methods via their respective problem definitions as specified**. Submission Instructions will eventually be posted at the botttom of this spec *(once we figure out how soon we can get Repl up-and-running)*; though the backup option will be submitting a .java file to the Google Classroom. Stay Tuned...
* **Your code will be tested for correctness via being called with a number of test cases**; such that your score on each will follow from the percent of test cases passed. Refer to the assignment rubric (TBD - still working on it) for additional grading information. 
* **Academic Integrity/Honesty:** With the exception of code presented by the instructor (i.e. provided to the class for use, demonstrated in class, etc.): all code that you submit must only be that which you alone have written; ***(i.e. you must NOT share or discuss code with other students!)*** We may utilize plaigarism detection mechanisms, may ask you any questions about your implementation code, and conduct further investigation. If plagiarism is confirmed: a first offense will result in an instant zero on the assignment and friendly warning not to do it again (i.e. a "slap on the wrist"). Further violaions will follow from our courses' **"Zero-Tolerance, Maximum-Penalty"** policy; and range from parent/admin referral to expulsion from the course! If you're concerned about whether your work on assignment might be a violation of academic integrity: ask the instructor ASAP!
* **That said: you are allowed (if not encouraged!) to collaborate with your classmates** in terms of discussing 'high-level' ideas and algorithms pertaining to possible solutions (though nothing as/more detailed than pseudocode). ***If you're unsure about what can 'legally' be discussed: again - ask the instructor!** If you do work with a group, **you MUST provide the names of your collaborator(s) in either a README document or within a header comment block** within your submission source code file(s). As mentioned in class: we will not be micromanaging who you work with and how you do it; but we do suggest that you avoid working with classmates who do not make an effort to contribute ideas or productive discussion (i.e. 'dead weight'); and your otherwise mutually beneficial teammate(s) and yourself are welcome to email the instructor if such people are taking unfair advantage. We'll honor your annonymity and find a way to resolve the situation as best as possible.
* **Another caveat: the one kind of code of which you are welcome (and also encouraged) to share are test cases** for the various problems. Indeed: ***we will be releasing our test cases within a few days***, which will be the very ones used to evaluate (i.e. grade) your code!
* **Lastly: the classic 'Subject To Change Statement'**. While the content and number of these problems is unlikely to change, we may add details for clarification or even add/remove them as needed (typical in new{er} programming courses). You will be provided notice and explanation whenever such events occur, sans things like minor spelling corrections. We will NEVER modify an assignment in an adverse manner (i.e. purposely make the work harder); and will try to NOT change an assignment anytime after 5:00PM on the ~3rd day after an assignment is posted.

## Part 2 : Some Parsing and Processing Methods

### lettersInSentence
```Java
public static String lettersInSentence(String sentence)
```
* **Purpose:** Returns a string of unique characters in the range `[a...z]`, in alphabetical order; such that the appearence of a character implies it appears at least once in the input string sentence. Characters in the range `[A...Z]` can (i.e. should) be converted to lower-case. Disregard all other characters in the string. You may NOT use any data structures from the Java Collections Framework.
* **Input:** `String sentence` – the input sentence
* **Hint:** We went over this exact method in class a week ago (told 'ya I'd include it as a HW problem!) That Said, another hint is that you only need to worry about alphabet characters.

### lettersCountInSentence
```Java
public static String[] lettersCountInSentence(String sentence)
```
* **Purpose:** Returns an array of Strings in which each is composed of a unique character in the range `[a...z]`, followed by a colon character (i.e. `:`), followed by a number `{x | (x>0)` indicating how many times it appears in the sentence. The array elements should be in alphabetical order WRT their alphabet character component. Characters in the range `[A...Z]` can (i.e. should) be converted to lower-case and counted with their respective lower-case char (i.e. count `E` with all occurences of `e`). Disregard all other characters in the string. You may NOT use any data structures from the Java Collections Framework.
* **Input:** `String sentence` – the input sentence
* **Hint:** (As we also noted last week) you might want to get `lettersInSentence` working first; as this code (should) build thereupon.
* **Example 1:** 
  * **Input:** `"Banana!"`
  * **Output:** `{"a:3","b:1","n:2"}`
* **Example 2:** 
  * **Input:** `"A maroon balloon, floating to the Moon... in a monsoon!"`
  * **Output:** `{"a:5","b:1","e:1","f:1","g:1","h:1","i:2","l:3","m:3","n:7",o:11","r:1","s:1","t:3",}`

### charsInSentence
```Java
public static String charsInSentence(String sentence)
```
* **Purpose:** Return a string of unique characters such that the appearence of a character implies it appears at least once in the input string `sentence`. The only characters that need to be supported are those of ASCII range `[32,...,127]` (decimal index). Data Structure classes from the **Java Collections Framework may be used to solve this problem**.
* **Input:** `String sentence` – the input sentence
* **Hint 1:** You're allowed to use a Data Structure from the Java Collections Framework, and we **(strongly)** encourage doing so. If peer pressure further helps to motivate this point: our solution does exactly this!
* **Hint 2:** Uppercase letters will now be DISTINCT from lowercase (i.e. `'q'!='Q'` this time!)
* **Note:** If you still want to homebrew this, and request our assistance to help you accomplish this - we will ONLY do so upon reviewing AND approving two items from your current progress. 
  * **First:** a correctly implemented version of this method using one of the 'Collections' data structures. 
  * **Second:** a correctly implemented `lettersInSentence` method.

### charsCountInSentence
```Java
public static CharAndCount[] charsCountInSentence(String sentence, char orderType)
```
* **Purpose:** Return an array of `(char,int)` two-tuples such that the char component is a unique character in the ASCII range `[32,...,127]` and the int component is the total number of times `(0>x)` it appears in the sentence. The array elements should be ordered WRT to the type specified in the relevant input parm, for which there are two types. Type `'c'` implies by-char (i.e. `[{'A',10},{'B',2},{'F',35},{'a',55}]`); while type `'t'` implies by-total in increasing order (i.e. `[{'B',2},{'A',10},{'F',35},{'a',55}]`). for the latter type, settle ties via by-char order (i.e. resolve `[{'B',9},{'F',1},{'G',9}]` as `[{'B',9},{'G',9},{'F',1}]`, NOT as `[{'G',9},{'B',9},{'F',1}]`). Java Collections Framework may be used to solve this problem**.
* **Inputs:**
  * `String sentence` - the input sentence
  * `char orderType` - means of output ordering, where `'c'=>'by-char'` and `'t'=>'by-total'` 
* **Hint:** Same as with `charsInSentence`, and you MIGHT want to read the note below...
* **Note:** You (hopefully) might have noticed that the return type `'CharAndCount'` in the method header is not a built-in Java Class. Quite Right. You'll need to write your own, and it needs to agree with what our tester script will be expecting. Fear Not: We show you exactly what ours looks like below. You might also note that we're not using Java Encapsulation in our definition; this is to keep things simple (though we may do so later on).

```Java
public class CharAndCount{
  /*--------------------------------------------------------------------
  |> Object State i.e. char represented by this object and total number
  |  of times it appeared in the input String. Note also our use of the
  |  underscore (i.e. '_') character for the names, especially the char
  |  variable. This is one way underscore prefixes are utilized in Java;
  |  especially for the event that the best name is, unfortunately, also
  |  the same name of the [data]type. Especially if such is a primitive
  |  type or some otherwise reserved keyword in Java.
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  public char _char;  
  public int  _total;

  /*--------------------------------------------------------------------
  |> This is the [object] constructor for this class. If you know what
  |  that is, great! If not all you need to know is that to create a new
  |  CharAndCount object, you need to do ***something*** like this:
  |    // assuming input sentence = "banana"
  |    CharAndCount myExample = new CharAndCount('a',3);
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  public CharAndCount(char chr, total tot){
    // Here's another hint/reminder, BTW :-)
    if(t==0){System.out.println("Appears ZERO times? Sure you wanna add it?!?");}
    _char  = chr;
    _total = tot;
  } // Ends Constructor
} // Ends Class CharAndCount
```

## Part 3 : Caesar Cipher Encrypting/Decrypting

### Instructions:
The 'Caesar Cipher' [(Wikipedia Link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) was used by Gaius Julius Caesar himself for his private correspondence. We'll implement the simplest version in this assignment (and maybe step things up to more intermediate cryptographic methods in future assignments). The simplest version involves an **encoding step** of 'shifting' (analogously, 'rotating') the alphabet by some number of characters **x** in one of two directions **d** {left xor right}, then a **decoding step** of shifting the characters of the encrypted message **x** characters in the opposite direction. The offset **x** and direction **d** thus become the 'keys' used to encrypt and decrypt the message. Correspondingly, implement the following two methods...

### caesarCipherEncrypt
```Java
public static String caesarCipherEncrypt(String input, int offKey, char rotDir)
```
* **Purpose:** Given a message to be encrypted, an offset key, and rotation direction - encrypt the message into its corresponding encrypted form. Leave all other punctuation symbols (i.e. `' '`, `'.'`, `'!'`, etc.) intact and place; such that if `offkey=1` and `rotDir='r'`, the message `"hi there!"` would be `"ij uifsf!`. Also, to keep things simpler: let's stick with messages that use ONLY lower-case alphabet letters (though you're welcome to implement a method which supports upper-case as well!)
* **Inputs:**
  * `String input` - the message to be encrypted
  * `int offKey` - the number of characters to offset when encrypting (range `[0,...,25]`)
  * `char rotDir` - the direction `[left⊕right]` by which to offset characters (range `[0,...,25]`)
* **Example 1:** `caesarCipherEncrypt("secret",3,'r')=> "pbzobq"
* **Example 2:** `caesarCipherEncrypt("secret",7,'r')=> "lxvkxm"
* **Example 3:** `caesarCipherEncrypt("secret",4,'l')=> "wigvix"

### caesarCipherDecrypt
```Java
public static String caesarCipherDecrypt(String input, int offKey, char rotDir)
```
* **Purpose:** Given an encrypted message, an offset key, and rotation direction - decrypt the message back into its original non-encrypted form. Again: preserve all punctuation characters in-place and assume lower-case alphabet characters only.
* **Inputs:**
  * `String input` - the encrypted message to be decrypted
  * `int offKey` - the number of characters to offset when decrypting (range `[0,...,25]`)
  * `char rotDir` - the direction `[left⊕right]` by which **the message was originally encrypted**
* **Example 1:** `caesarCipherDecrypt("pbzobq",3,'r')=> "secret"
* **Example 2:** `caesarCipherDecrypt("lxvkxm",7,'r')=> "secret"
* **Example 3:** `caesarCipherDecrypt("wigvix",4,'l')=> "secret"
* **Hint 1:** There's some text bolded in the description of parm `rotDir` for a reason.
* **Hint 2:** Depending on your implementation of `caesarCipherEncrypt`, you may only need to change ONE CHARACTER of that code to solve this one!!!
