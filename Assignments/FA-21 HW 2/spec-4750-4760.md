# FH-4750/4760 FA-21 : Assignment 2

### Assigned: 8/23/21 @ 05:00 PM MST
### Due: 8/30/21 @ 11:59 PM MST
### Version: 1.0 8/23/21

## General Instructions:

* **Implement solutions for the following methods via their respective problem definitions as specified**. Submission Instructions will eventually be posted at the botttom of this spec *(once we figure out how soon we can get Repl up-and-running)*; though the backup option will be submitting a .java file to the Google Classroom. Stay Tuned...
* **Your code will be tested for correctness via being called with a number of test cases**; such that your score on each will follow from the percent of test cases passed. Refer to the assignment rubric (TBD - still working on it) for additional grading information. 
* **Academic Integrity/Honesty:** With the exception of code presented by the instructor (i.e. provided to the class for use, demonstrated in class, etc.): all code that you submit must only be that which you alone have written; ***(i.e. you must NOT share or discuss code with other students!)*** We may utilize plaigarism detection mechanisms, may ask you any questions about your implementation code, and conduct further investigation. If plagiarism is confirmed: a first offense will result in an instant zero on the assignment and friendly warning not to do it again (i.e. a "slap on the wrist"). Further violaions will follow from our courses' **"Zero-Tolerance, Maximum-Penalty"** policy; and range from parent/admin referral to expulsion from the course! If you're concerned about whether your work on assignment might be a violation of academic integrity: ask the instructor ASAP!
* **That said: you are allowed (if not encouraged!) to collaborate with your classmates** in terms of discussing 'high-level' ideas and algorithms pertaining to possible solutions (though nothing as/more detailed than pseudocode). ***If you're unsure about what can 'legally' be discussed: again - ask the instructor!** If you do work with a group, **you MUST provide the names of your collaborator(s) in either a README document or within a header comment block** within your submission source code file(s). As mentioned in class: we will not be micromanaging who you work with and how you do it; but we do suggest that you avoid working with classmates who do not make an effort to contribute ideas or productive discussion (i.e. 'dead weight'); and your otherwise mutually beneficial teammate(s) and yourself are welcome to email the instructor if such people are taking unfair advantage. We'll honor your annonymity and find a way to resolve the situation as best as possible.
* **Another caveat: the one kind of code of which you are welcome (and also encouraged) to share are test cases** for the various problems. Indeed: ***we will be releasing our test cases within a few days***, which will be the very ones used to evaluate (i.e. grade) your code!
* **Lastly: the classic 'Subject To Change Statement'**. While the content and number of these problems is unlikely to change, we may add details for clarification or even add/remove them as needed (typical in new{er} programming courses). You will be provided notice and explanation whenever such events occur, sans things like minor spelling corrections. We will NEVER modify an assignment in an adverse manner (i.e. purposely make the work harder); and will try to NOT change an assignment anytime after 5:00PM on the ~3rd day after an assignment is posted.
